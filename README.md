# Passify
Passify, the name comes from the word Password. Hence, the process to create a password or a password creator was named as Passify.

## Why?
Passify, Retraceable Password Generator, was created to prevent Google, Facebook and other sign up supports from capturing the data of the user. When a person signs up with the help of these services, the service providers get to know the user activity and affiliation to particular website in which the user is signing in.
General Public maintains a single master password which they use for signing up in each and every service that they enroll in. Either their should be a universal sign-in for all the services. But, the desire to monetize each and every data fragment for their personal use (especially for their Machine Learning Algorithms).
